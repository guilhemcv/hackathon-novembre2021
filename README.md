# Hackathon 1 - November 2021

First Hackathon during my training at Wild Code School.
During 48h, we had to create an application in relation with music in a group of 4 people.
We decided to create an app for deaf people, in order to make them feel the music through the vibrations of the phone.
Only available on Android phones due to limitations on IOS devices.
