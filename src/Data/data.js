We will, we will rock you, yeah \n Buddy, you're an old man, poor man Pleading with your eyes, gonna get you some peace someday You got mud on your face, big disgrace \n Somebody better put you back into your place, do it! \n We will, we will rock you, yeah, yeah, come on We will, we will rock you, alright, louder! We will, we will rock you, one more time We will, we will rock you Yeah",

And when I look back at all the crazy fights we had Like some kind of madness Was taking control Yeah And now I have finally seen the light And I have finally realized What you need Mm And now I have finally seen the end (Finally seen the end) And I'm not expecting you to care (Expecting you to care) But I have finally seen the light (Finally seen the light) I have finally realized (Realized) I need to love I need to love Come to me, Trust in your dream Come on and rescue me Yes I have known, I can be wrong Maybe I'm too headstrong Our love is Madness",
